# UEP

Hi everyone this is my first project coded purely in HTML, CSS and Javascript no frameworks or libraries.
This is a website of my Alma Mater University of Eastern Philippines.
This is actually a clone website of Eastern Visayas State University www.evsu.edu.ph
I was inspired by their web design and challenged myself to clone it without using any frameworks/libraries.
